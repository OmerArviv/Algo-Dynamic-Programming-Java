# Algo-Dynamic-Programming-Java

Dynamic Programming:

A stable tower:
A routine should be developed with O(n2) efficiency that receives as input three arrays: Length, Width and Height containing
Each n natural numbers are different from each other, which make up the length, width and height dimensions of n boxes.
The dimensions of the i-th box 1≤i≤n)) are: Length[i]x Width[i]x Height[i] (the boxes should not be rotated).
The routine must present a stable tower of maximum height and return its rate.
Note: A tower will be called stable if for each box i located above box j there exists Length[i]< Length[j] and
 Width[i]< Width[j]
Use a main routine that calls twice the routine you developed. First time with 20 boxes and once
A second with thirty boxes. Determine in arrays different random numbers from the domain [1,200].
Show the program code and the resulting output.
